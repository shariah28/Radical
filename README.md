# Radical
Simple Chat Application
I created this simple chat application, which I named Radical, as a solo term project for a Wireless Networks and Communications course to showcase my skills. Within this chat application, I used Python programming along with Socket Programming to allow multiple users to join my server. I incorporated a customizable username feature, as well as a feature that allows each user message to be broadcast to all active users on this TCP server. I used TCP because I wanted reliable data transfer for my chat application, as UDP isn't reliable when it comes to data transfer and connectivity.
